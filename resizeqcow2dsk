## Major headache resizing the root file system partition on my virtual windows machine this evening.
## All sources suggested using virt-resize --expand. This method involves creating a new, larger qcow2, combining it with the old, and then combining the two. 
## A final step involved expanding the original file to the new file, thus expanding the usable partition space. 
## This did not work for me. Try this instead:
## Details: kvm virtual windows 10 machine, running on an Ubuntu 16 host. 8GB Ram, 25GB Storage, 2 core processor. Image is in qcow2 format. 

## 1. Turn off the guest machine and open a terminal on the host machine

## 2. Download tools (https://serverfault.com/questions/324281/how-do-you-increase-a-kvm-guests-disk-space)
## Install libvirt file system utilities package
$ sudo apt-get install libguestfs-tools
# Test to see if it works (it won't) -- you need to see "===== TEST FINISHED OK =====" at the bottom:
$ sudo libguestfs-test-tool
# If you don't see "===== TEST FINISHED OK =====" at the bottom then repair it:
$ sudo update-guestfs-appliance
# Run the test again and verify it works
$ sudo libguestfs-test-tool

## 3. Find image
## I found these in /var/lib/libvirt/images

## 4. Check out size and partitions of image. Remember, the partitions you see are not root. They are elements of the VM image file. 
$ sudo virt-filesystems --long --parts --blkdevs -h -a name-of-guest-disk-file

## 5. Back up image by making a copy in the directory
cp windows.qcow2 windowsog.qcow2

## 6. Change size of disk
qemu-img resize windows.qcow2 +5GB

## 7. Check size of disk and partitions again to see the difference
$ sudo virt-filesystems --long --parts --blkdevs -h -a windows.qcow2

## 8. Change size of virtual root partition to use the newly allocated disk space
## This really through me for a loop. 
## There is a lot of device out there that involves using gparted, virt-resize --expand, a live disk, or the Windows disk manager.
## None of these worked for me. Instead, I downloaded a third party piece of software, and did the adjustment in the guest, using a GUI.
## It worked perfect
## Try EaseUS Partition Master, free version.

## 9. Restart the system
