## Major headache resizing the root file system partition on my virtual windows machine this evening.
## All sources suggested using virt-resize --expand. This method involves creating a new, larger qcow2, combining it with the old, and then combining the two. 
## A final step involved expanding the original file to the new file, thus expanding the usable partition space. 
## This did not work for me. Try this instead:
## Details: kvm virtual windows 10 machine, running on an Ubuntu 16 host. 8GB Ram, 25GB Storage, 2 core processor. Image is in qcow2 format. 
## Download tools


## Find image


## Check out size and partitions of image. Remember, the partitions you see are not root. They are elements of the VM image file. 

## Change size of disk


## Change size of partition
## This really through me for a loop. 
## There is a lot of device out there that involves using gparted, virt-resize --expand, a live disk, or the Windows disk manager.
## None of these worked for me. Instead, I downloaded a third party piece of software, and did the adjustment in the guest, using a GUI.
## It worked perfect
## Try EaseUS Partition Manager, free version.
